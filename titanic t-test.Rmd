```{r}
titanic.df <- read.csv(paste("Titanic Data.csv"), sep= ",")
```

#task 4b
 create a table showing the average age of the survivors and the average age of the people who died.
 
```{r}
aggregate(titanic.df$Age,by=list(titanic.df$Survived),mean)
```
 

#task 4(c)
run a t-test to test the following hypothesis:
H2: The Titanic survivors were younger than the passengers who died.

null hypothesis : there is no significant difference between the average age of people who survived and those do not.

```{r}
 t.test(Age~Survived,data=titanic.df)
```

since the p-value >0.05 we cannot reject null hypothesis. thus there is no significant difference between the average age of people who survived and who didn't.
